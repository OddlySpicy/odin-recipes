        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large baking potatoes, scrubbed</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon ground paprika</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>8 slices cooked bacon, crumbled</li>
            <li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>4 stalks green onion, sliced</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Prick potatoes
                several times with a fork and place onto a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced
                with a fork, 50 minutes to 1 hour. Remove from the oven.
            </li>
            <li>When potatoes are cool enough to handle, cut them lengthwise
                and scoop out flesh to within 1/4 inch of skin. Reserve flesh
                for another use. Place skins back onto the baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>Combine olive oil, Parmesan cheese, salt, garlic powder, paprika,
                and pepper in a small bowl; brush over both sides of skins.
            </li>
            <li>Return to the oven and bake until very crisp, about 10 minutes, 
                turning skins halfway through.
            </li>
            <li>Springle skins with Cheddar cheese and bacon. Return to the oven
                and bake until cheese is melted, about 2 more minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Serve topped with sour cream and green onions.</li>
        </ol>
